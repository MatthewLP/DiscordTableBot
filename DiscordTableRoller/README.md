# Discord Table Bot

This bot is ment to be used on discord channels with friends. It allows for the creation
of custom tables for which the entries are chosen randomly. I hope to slowly add features
allowing for the bot to be set up on particular channels with tables loaded separately
for each channel or for entire servers. But at the moment it loads all files from one
directory and those files are available for all

## Getting Started

To get this up and running for development you would ideally need Visual Studio 2017
(although this is not technically required), discord.py, a discord account, and a bot
account to attach the bot to.

## Deployment

Basically the same as getting started sans the Visual Studio.
